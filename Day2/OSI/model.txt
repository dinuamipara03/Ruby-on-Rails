Layers of the OSI Model
There are 7 layers in the OSI Model and each layer has its specific role in handling data. All the layers are mentioned below:

Physical Layer:

    Functions of the Physical Layer
    Bit Synchronization: The physical layer provides the synchronization of the bits by providing a clock. This clock controls both sender and receiver thus providing synchronization at the bit level.
    Bit Rate Control: The Physical layer also defines the transmission rate i.e. the number of bits sent per second.
    Physical Topologies: Physical layer specifies how the different, devices/nodes are arranged in a network i.e. bus topology, star topology, or mesh topology.
    Transmission Mode: Physical layer also defines how the data flows between the two connected devices. The various transmission modes possible are Simplex, half-duplex and full duplex.


Data Link Layer:

    Functions of the Data Link Layer
    Framing: Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver. This can be accomplished by attaching special bit patterns to the beginning and end of the frame.
    Physical Addressing: After creating frames, the Data link layer adds physical addresses (MAC addresses) of the sender and/or receiver in the header of each frame.
    Error Control: The data link layer provides the mechanism of error control in which it detects and retransmits damaged or lost frames.
    Flow Control: The data rate must be constant on both sides else the data may get corrupted thus, flow control coordinates the amount of data that can be sent before receiving an acknowledgment.
    Access Control: When a single communication channel is shared by multiple devices, the MAC sub-layer of the data link layer helps to determine which device has control over the channel at a given time.


Network Layer:

    Functions of the Network Layer
    Routing: The network layer protocols determine which route is suitable from source to destination. This function of the network layer is known as routing.
    Logical Addressing: To identify each device inter-network uniquely, the network layer defines an addressing scheme. The sender and receiver’s IP addresses are placed in the header by the network layer. Such an address distinguishes each device uniquely and universally.


Transport Layer:

    Functions of the Transport Layer
    Segmentation and Reassembly: This layer accepts the message from the (session) layer and breaks the message into smaller units. Each of the segments produced has a header associated with it. The transport layer at the destination station reassembles the message.
    Service Point Addressing: To deliver the message to the correct process, the transport layer header includes a type of address called service point address or port address. Thus, by specifying this address, the transport layer makes sure that the message is delivered to the correct process.
    
    Services Provided by Transport Layer:
    Connection-Oriented Service
    Connectionless Service


Session Layer:

    Functions of the Session Layer
    Session Establishment, Maintenance, and Termination: The layer allows the two processes to establish, use, and terminate a connection.
    Synchronization: This layer allows a process to add checkpoints that are considered synchronization points in the data. These synchronization points help to identify the error so that the data is re-synchronized properly, and ends of the messages are not cut prematurely, and data loss is avoided.
    Dialog Controller: The session layer allows two systems to start communication with each other in half-duplex or full duplex.


Presentation Layer:

    Functions of the Presentation Layer
    Translation: For example, ASCII to EBCDIC.
    Encryption/ Decryption: Data encryption translates the data into another form or code. The encrypted data is known as the ciphertext, and the decrypted data is known as plain text. A key value is used for encrypting as well as decrypting data.
    Compression: Reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted on the network.


Application Layer:

    Functions of the Application Layer
    Network Virtual Terminal (NVT): It allows a user to log on to a remote host.
    File Transfer Access and Management (FTAM): This application allows a user to access files in a remote host, retrieve files in a remote host, and manage or control files from a remote computer.
    Mail Services: Provide email service.
    Directory Services: This application provides distributed database sources and access for global information about various objects and services.



Application Layer: Applications create the data.
Presentation Layer: Data is formatted and encrypted.
Session Layer: Connections are established and managed.
Transport Layer: Data is broken into segments for reliable delivery.
Network Layer: Segments are packaged into packets and routed.
Data Link Layer: Packets are framed and sent to the next device.
Physical Layer: Frames are converted into bits and transmitted physically.








How Does Communication Happen in the OSI Model? A Practical Example
Let’s consider how OSI layers play a role in an everyday activity like sending an email to a person overseas:

    When a user in New York sends an email to a colleague in London, the process starts at the Application Layer (Layer 7). The user’s email client, such as Outlook, uses SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to handle the email message.
    The email is then passed to the Presentation Layer (Layer 6), where it is formatted and encrypted to ensure proper transmission.
    Next, the email moves to the Session Layer (Layer 5), where a session is established between the sender’s email server in New York and the receiver’s email server in London. This layer manages the session, keeping the connection open long enough to send the email.
    The email data then reaches the Transport Layer (Layer 4), where it is divided into smaller packets. TCP ensures these packets are sent reliably and in the correct order.
    At the Network Layer (Layer 3), each packet is assigned source and destination IP addresses, allowing it to be routed through multiple networks, including routers and switches, to reach the recipient in London.
    The Data Link Layer (Layer 2) then uses MAC addresses to handle the packets’ journey across local networks and correcting any errors that occur.
    Finally, the Physical Layer (Layer 1) converts the data into electrical signals, which are transmitted over fiber-optic cables under the Atlantic Ocean.

Upon reaching the recipient’s server in London, the process is reversed:

    The Physical Layer converts the signals back into data packets, which are reassembled at the Data Link Layer.
    The Network Layer ensures the packets have arrived correctly, and the Transport Layer reorders them if necessary.
    The Session Layer maintains the session until the email is fully received.
    The Presentation Layer decrypts and formats the email, and the Application Layer delivers the email to the client, where it appears in their inbox.
