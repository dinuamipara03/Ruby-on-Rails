A cipher is a method or algorithm used in cryptography for encrypting and decrypting data. It transforms readable plaintext into an unreadable ciphertext, and vice versa, using a key. Ciphers are essential for protecting sensitive information by making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to understand the message.
